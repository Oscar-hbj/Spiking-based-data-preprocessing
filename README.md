Raw data is the experiments of center-out tasks for one monkey, received from CAS. They conclude recorded brain activity and simultaneously behavior (the movement of cursor manipulated by the monkey)

The data description illustrates the basic information of one session.
The behavior structure is records the movement of the cursor in the experiments.
The process of data preprocessing briefly describes how we tranform the raw data to AI-Ready aligned data.
